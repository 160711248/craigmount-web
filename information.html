<h1> our information </h1> 
 
<p>Craigmount High School is a large comprehensive school located in West Edinburgh. Our projected roll next session is over 1250 and rising. The majority of our pupils come from our five associated primaries: Corstorphine, East Craigs, Fox Covert, Hillwood and Roseburn. In addition, we also receive a high number of placing requests. Our new school campus opened in 2004 and offers a high-quality learning environment. Visitors immediately pick up on an ethos  characterised by positive caring relationships and a fantastic staff team driven by a desire to ensure all pupils maximise their potential no matter their ability level. As a result, attainment levels are high, and last year 94.41% of leavers went on to a Positive Destination. High numbers of pupils take Advanced Higher in a wide range of subjects and the size of our school means we are able to offer Highers in a broad range of subjects. Typically, we have around 120 UCAS applications each year and high numbers of pupils going on to University, including Oxbridge. Staying on-rates are very high, with around 75% each year continuing on into S6. </p>
